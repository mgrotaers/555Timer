# 555Timer
KiCAD simulation of a 555 Timer

This is a KiCAD simulation of the original 555 Timer.

There are two KiCAD projects supplied to this repository.
1. 555Timer - Simulates the 555 timer as presented in Makezine with transistors, diodes and resistors.
2. 555TimerSub - This takes the 555 timer circuit in 555Timer and presents it in a subcircuit.
